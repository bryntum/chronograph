- None

#### BUG FIXES

- Fixed a bug, that on-demand calculations for lazy identifiers were performed in separate
transaction. This was breaking the `ProposedOrPrevious` effect. Such calculations are now
performed in the currently running transaction.

- Fixed a bug, that removing and adding an entity back to the graph right away was not updating
the related buckets.

- Fixed a bug, that transaction rejection could lead to exception if there were writes during
`finalizeCommitAsync` method.

- Fixed a bug, that identifier could be considered as unchanged mistakenly and its calculation
method not called.

- Fixed a bug, that using `derive` method of the mixin over the base class, that has extended
another class, in turn created with `derive`, could skip some mixin requirements.
